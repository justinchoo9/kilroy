# CRITICAL NOTE: Kilroy Attractor Metaspec Execution

When you are executing `docs/strongdm/attractor/kilroy-metaspec.md`, you MUST:

- Find the next requirement that is not yet implemented, and implement it.
- Continue iterating without stopping until the implementation is comprehensive and complete.
- Do not ask the user questions while executing the metaspec. Use local inspection, tool calls, and web lookups to resolve uncertainty and proceed.
- Defer setting up/running CXDB locally until after the Attractor implementation work is complete.
